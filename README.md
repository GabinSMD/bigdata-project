<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

1. Generate a weekly list (for the current week) showing, for each stock, its initial, final, minimum and maximum value for each share.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_main.py)
2. Generate a monthly list (for the current month) indicating, for each share, its initial, final, minimum and maximum value for each share.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_stock_list.py)
3. Given the name of a stock and a range of dates, obtain its minimum and maximum value of quotation, as well as the percentage decrease and increase from the initial quote value to the minimum and maximum, respectively.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_stock_infos.py)
4. Given the name of a stock, retrieve its lowest and highest quoted value for the last hour, week and month.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_stock_history.py)
5. Display the 5 stocks that have risen the most in the last week and month.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_stock_increase.py)
6. Display the 5 stocks that have fallen the most in the last week and month.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_stock_decrease.py)
7. Given a percentage and a range of dates, show the stocks that have had an increase of this percentage during this period.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_stock_evolution.py)
8.Given a time period, show the variation of the Top 5 stocks over this period. 
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_top_history.py)
9.Given a precise date, show the value of the top 5 stocks at that time.
  (https://github.com/GabinSMD/bigdata-project/main/project_top_date.py)
10.Given a percentage and a range of dates, show the stock list’s corresponding who have already been in the top 5
